    <h1>How does code even work?</h1>

    <h2>Variable = Value</h2>
    <p>A variable is a container that stores a value. A variable can be declared using the keyword "var", "let" or "const" and it is assigned a value using the assignment operator (=).
        A variable can store any type of value, including numbers, strings, objects, and functions. The value of a variable can be changed at any time by assigning a new value to it.
     A value, on the other hand, is a data that can be stored in a variable, or passed as an argument to a function, or returned from a function. In JavaScript, there are several types of values such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, null, Symbol, Object, Array</li>
            <li>value can be assigned to any of the<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive" target="_blank">7 primitive types</a> </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
   
    <h2>Function</h2>
    <p>A function is a block of code that can be executed multiple times by calling it by its name. 
        A function can accept input in the form of parameters and it can return a value. 
        Functions are a fundamental building block in JavaScript and are used to organize and reuse code.
        Functions are a powerful feature of JavaScript, as they allow developers to organize their 
        code and easily reuse logic. This can make code more readable, easier to maintain and less prone to errors.
       <ul>
            <li>A function is defined using the keyword "function", followed by the function name, a list of parameters in parentheses, and the code to be executed in curly braces.</li>           
            <li>Functions can be called or invoked by using the function name followed by parentheses.</li>
            <li>Functions can also return a value using the "return" statement.</li>
       </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Methods</h3>
    <p>  A method is similar to a function, but it is called on an object 
        and has access to the properties and other methods of that object.
        JavaScript has many built-in objects such as Array, String, Date, and Math, 
        and each of these objects has a set of methods that can be used to perform certain operations. 
        For example, the Array object has methods like push, pop, and splice, and
         the String object has methods like charAt, toUpperCase, and split. 
         In short, a method is a function that is associated with an object, 
         and it can access the properties and other methods of that object.
    </p>

    <h3>Expression</h3>
    <p>In JavaScript, an expression is a piece of code that evaluates 
        to a value. Expressions can be a combination of literals, 
        variables, operators and function calls. Examples of expressions 
        include mathematical equations (2 + 2), 
        function calls (Math.random()), and property access (object.property).
         Expressions can be used in various parts of JavaScript such as in assignments,
          function arguments, and in control flow statements.</p>

    <h3>Debugger</h3>
    <p>
        The debugger tool in the Google Chrome web developer tools is powerful 
        because it allows developers to step through the JavaScript code of a 
        website or web application line by line, which can help them identify 
        and fix errors in the code. With the debugger, developers can set breakpoints, 
        inspect variables, and see the call stack, which can make it easier to 
        understand the flow of control through the code and identify where problems are occurring.
        Additionally, the webtool also offers other powerful tools such as Profiler, Network, Lighthouse, DevTools Protocol, and many more. All these tools are designed to help developers to inspect, debug, and optimize the performance of their web application.
        Some of the features of the chrome debugger tool are:
        <ul>
            <li>Setting breakpoints: Allows developers to pause the execution of code at specific points, so they can inspect the state of variables and the call stack at that point in time.</li>
            <li>Stepping through code: Developers can step through the code line by line, which can help them understand how the code is executing and identify where bugs are occurring.</li>
             <li>Inspecting variables: Developers can inspect the values of variables at different points in the code, which can help them understand how the code is behaving.</li>
             <li>Call stack inspection: Developers can see the call stack, which shows the sequence of function calls that led to the current point in the code. This can help them understand how the code is executing and identify where bugs are occurring.</li>
        </ul>
 
</p>
